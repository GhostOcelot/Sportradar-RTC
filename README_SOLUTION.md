## How to run the app:

- run the docker container with simulation api with `docker-compose up` and keep the container running
- in a separate terminal install the project dependencies with `npm install`
- for real time updates run development version with `npm run dev`
- you can then test the app in Postman or the browser under [this link](http://localhost:4000/client/state)

You can also build the bundle and run it with `npm run build` and once the build is complete `npm run start`.
